## Focus on the why

Berman is an independent, Boston-based creative agency founded in 2002. We bring worthwhile things to the attention of people who can make good use of them.

And that’s always a challenge because, even when it’s good for them, most people don’t want to change or even think about something different.

Over the past 15 years, we’ve developed a method to help brands answer their prospects’ biggest question: "Why should I care?"

Integrity: Our clients trust us with the public face of their brands. We need to earn that trust with everything we do. There are no shortcuts to responsibility.

----

Ability: Everyone at Berman is talented and committed to honing their skills. We owe it to our clients to be as good as we can be at everything we do.

----

Spirit: What we do is often fun, but it ain’t easy. Good work combines a deep insight into the problem with the joy of discovery, and then shining a light on that.
